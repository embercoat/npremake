<p>The welcming period will skip from social activities and jovial student traditions, like day-trips, games, student section days and&nbsp;welcoming dinners. The exchange students also&nbsp;get a crash course in Swedish during the days. </p>
<p>What then, ultimately, is the purpose of this period of hectic associating? Well, to stimulate you and your coming of age as fully fledged students at the Lule&aring; University of Technology! We hope that you look forward to commence your studies at LTU and bid you a warm welcome to our University. </p>
